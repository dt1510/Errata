This a public repository gathering errata for mathematical books. Please, feel free to contribute.

Naming conventions:
For a book that does not have an errata file in this repository yet, put the new errata file into a folder with the subject name under which it falls. The errata file should be named in small capitals with no spaces but underscores instead in a form:
author1_author2_..._authorn_book_title.md
